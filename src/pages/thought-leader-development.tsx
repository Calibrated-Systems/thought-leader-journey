          <p>Note: This developmental framework represents the evolution of a thought leader's role, focus, and capabilities. It operates in parallel with the community transformation journey, brand recognition cycle, and organizational structure evolution. The journey isn't necessarily linearâ€”some thought leaders may choose to focus at specific stages where they find fulfillment and impact, rather than progressing through all phases.</p>
          <p>Each stage builds upon the previous one, requiring mastery of earlier capabilities before advancing. The transitions between phases represent significant shifts in how the thought leader approaches their work and interacts with their audience.
